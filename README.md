### Main Screen and Transaction Screen
The main screen is divided into different sections:
- The current balance and a chart showing the total of expenses and income
- A short list of the first 4 transaction (by clicking on the "mostra di piu" button you get redirected to the transaction list page)
- A floating button to add a transaction

The transaction screen contains different aspects to create the transaction.
Apart the classic functionalities, an interesting one is:
- Changing the currency by clicking on the ``â‚¬`` symbol (dollars, pounds and euros are supported)
